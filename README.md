## Spencer Maguire's CPSC 210 Personal Project

### A fun pokemon battle simulator!

What better way to test my computer science skills than to 
create something that already exists! This is going to be a 
simple 3v3 pokemon battle simulator, including 
* typings 
* critical hits 
* a plethora of moves 
* and more! 

Unfortunately, I will be excluding 
* items 
* abilities
* and secondary effects from attacks
* maybe status effects?

*(subject to change if I end up having time).*

If you are
not familiar with pokemon battles, they are a simple turn-based
battle simulator, where player 1 does a move, then player 2 
does a move! 

This project is with the intention of appealing to 
someone looking to spend some free time playing a little bit of 
video games! The perfect thing about this game is that most games
are quite short, being around **5 minutes** depending on how fast you 
want to play. I am a huge fan of pokemon myself, and think that 
creating something I'm both passionate about and knowledge on 
how to make can make this project fun for me!
